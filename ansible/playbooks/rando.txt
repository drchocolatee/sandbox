To offload data from Elasticsearch node 1 to Elasticsearch node 2, you need to use the reindex API. This process involves reindexing documents from one index to another, specifying the source and destination nodes.

Below are the steps and commands to perform this operation:

Step 1: Set Up Elasticsearch Nodes
Ensure that both Elasticsearch nodes are part of the same cluster or can communicate with each other. Verify their status with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "http://<node1_ip>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
curl -X GET "http://<node2_ip>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"

Step 2: Reindex Data from Node 1 to Node 2
Use the _reindex API to transfer data from an index on Node 1 to an index on Node 2. Replace <source_index> with the name of your source index on Node 1 and <destination_index> with the name of your destination index on Node 2.

bash
curl -X POST "http://<node2_ip>:9200/_reindex" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "source": {
    "remote": {
      "host": "http://<node1_ip>:9200"
    },
    "index": "<source_index>"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "<destination_index>"
  }
}
'

Step 3: Verify Data Transfer
After the reindex operation, verify that the data has been transferred successfully by checking the document count in the destination index:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "http://<node2_ip>:9200/<destination_index>/_count?pretty"
Step 4: Clean Up (Optional)
If you need to delete the data from the source index on Node 1 after confirming the transfer, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE "http://<node1_ip>:9200/<source_index>?pretty"



Example Commands
Here is a concrete example assuming:

Node 1 IP: 192.168.1.10
Node 2 IP: 192.168.1.11
Source Index: source_index
Destination Index: destination_index
Check Cluster Health:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.10:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.11:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
Reindex Data:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.11:9200/_reindex" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "source": {
    "remote": {
      "host": "http://192.168.1.10:9200"
    },
    "index": "source_index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "destination_index"
  }
}
'
Verify Data Transfer:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.11:9200/destination_index/_count?pretty"
Delete Source Index (Optional):

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.1.10:9200/source_index?pretty"
These commands should help you offload data from Elasticsearch node 1 to node 2 effectively.
